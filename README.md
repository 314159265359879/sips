# Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

The SIPs describe the design, implementation, and governance
of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.  The SIP process
([SIP-000](./sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md))
describes how to make a SIP and get it ratified.  Anyone in the Stacks community
may submit a SIP.
