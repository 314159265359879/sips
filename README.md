# Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

The SIPs describe the design, implementation, and governance
of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.  The SIP process
([SIP-000](./sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md))
describes how to make a SIP and get it ratified.  Anyone in the Stacks community
may submit a SIP.

## How to Get Involved

There are several ways you can get involved with the SIP process:

* **SIP Editor**.  SIP editors help SIP authors make sure their SIPs are
  well-formed and follow the right process.  They help get SIPs ready for deep
review by advancing it them from Draft to Accepted status.  If you want to become a SIP editor, 
open an issue with your name and email to ask to be added to the list of SIP editors.

* **Joining a Consideration Advisory Board**.  SIPs fall under the purview of
  one or more considerations, such as "technical," "economic," "governance,"
and so on.  A full list is in the `considerations/` directory.  Members of SIP
consideration advisory boards use their domain expertise to give Accepted SIPs a
deep read, and give the authors any/all feedback to help make the SIP workable.
If you want to join a board, reach out to the board's chairperson via the
listed contact information.

* **Creating a Consideration Advisory Board**.  Anyone can create a
consideration advisory board by opening a PR to create a new
consideration track, and SIP authors can opt to have you review their work by
adding your consideration to the SIP's list of considerations.  You are expected
to vote on such SIPs in a fair and timely manner if you start a board.

* **Steering Committee**.  The Steering Committee organizes the consideration
  advisory boards and votes to advance Recommended SIPs to
Activation-in-Progress status, and then to either Ratified or Rejected status.
Once they are in the process of being activated,
they use a SIP's Activation section to determine whether or not the Stacks
ecosystem has ratified or rejected the SIP.  Joining this committee requires the
consent of the Stacks Foundation board.
